## Catalogs

### 1GeV_match_5sigma.dat
This is the 1-GeV five-sigma catalogue discussed in the paper that comprises the bulk of the highest-fidelity sources.  The columns in the catalogue contain the initial determinination of the likelihood, the improved position and the nearest source in the Third Fermi Catalogue.

### 1GeV_match_3sigma.dat

This is the 1-GeV three-sigma catalogue discussed in the paper.  The columns in the catalogue contain the initial determinination but no improvement of the position, and the nearest source in the Third Fermi Catalogue.

### 100MeV_match_5sigma.dat

This is the 100-MeV five-sigma catalogue discussed in the paper.  The columns in the catalogue contain the initial determinination but no improvement of the position, and the nearest source in the Third Fermi Catalogue.
